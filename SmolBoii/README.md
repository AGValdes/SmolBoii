## How It Works
- Tap your SmolBoi to see how he is doing!
- If he appears sad, try feeding him some star dust by tapping the star twice!
- Make sure to tap SmolBoi after each action, to check in!
- After he gets fed a few times, he will look up at the pink star bag.
- If you tap it, it will reveal a gift from you SmolBoi!
